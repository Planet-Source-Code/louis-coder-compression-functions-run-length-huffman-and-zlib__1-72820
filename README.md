## compression functions \(run length, Huffman and ZLib\)


</div>

### Description

Here you get 3 types of compression functions:

1) a run length encoding ("hellohellohello"-&gt;3*"hello") 2) a Huffman compression (with Huffman tree, where more frequent chars get a shorter bit string in output file) and 3) a VB interface to the ZLib compression (ZLib.dll was written by someone else).

You can also compress and pack several files into one compressed file (CompressionPack) and unpack them again.

Please note that my self made compression (1) and 2)) is not that fast and efficient, but good for learning purposes. If you have questions understanding the code or the basing ideas go to www.louis-coder.com and mail me!
 
### More Info
 
To open the project with VB5, remove the 'Ratained=0' line from 'GFCompression.vbp'!

Mail me if you need help!
